1)You can download git here: http://git-scm.com/downloads

Install Git with default settings.

Generating a pair of ssh keys:

     ssh-keygen -t rsa –C “xxxx@gmail.com"

The public key (id_rsa) should be sent to the owner of the repository in order to obtain work rights. Or upload to profile settings in bitbucket / github / gitlab.

Username and email settings:

     git config --global user.name “xx“
     git config --global user.email “xxxx@gmail.com"

Gives 2 keys public & private donot release private key.





2) Other than git bash we can use git GUI for projects
command : git gui&
- It will open gui
   resacn to check unstaged files


3) gitk is for viewing the history
command: gitk &


Revert commands:

Before doing add or commit or push
1)Modified few changes and didn't add, committed or pushed but wanted to undo the changes in the files
command: git checkout -- filename
ex: git checkout --commands.txt


In the above command we can only write one file name, to inlcude more file names we can write the following command
command: git checkout .

2)Inorder to delete files which are not yet committed or added previously use:
git clean --xdf
-xdf means f - force

After adding but not committed
1) command: git gui& 
change the staged to unstaged by clicking the file
      (or)
git reset -- filename
ex: git reset -- file.txt

After commiting :
1) committed but need to add few more changes to a file 
command: git commit --amend filename
ex: git commit --amed file.txt
(or)
can be done using the git gui& 
- add changes to thr file, open git gui
-the file will be present in both staged and unstaged area, move the file to staged and commit it with amed commit 

2) For undo the commit
commit : git reset HEAD~1

(or)
git reset HEAD^
