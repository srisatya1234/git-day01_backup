Install Git with default settings.

Generating a pair of ssh keys:

     ssh-keygen -t rsa –C “xxxx@gmail.com"

The public key (id_rsa) should be sent to the owner of the repository in order to obtain work rights. Or upload to profile settings in bitbucket / github / gitlab.

ex: git checkout --commands.txt


In the above command we can only write one file name, to inlcude more file names we can write the following command
command: git checkout .
